# Description
#  This script was designed to allow Admins the ability to scan every application installed under /Applications and return their 
#  app name, BundleID and CodeSignature to be used with Apples new Privacy Preference Policy Control  (PPPC) profile payload 
#  in the Transparency Consent and Control (TCC) framework.  
#
# Admins can either specify a specific app or binary by path or let the script look for any .app files under the /Applications/ directory.  
#
# If ran via a Jamf policy the output is echoed into the policy log and sent back to the Jamf Pro server.  If ran locally the results are displayed in terminal
